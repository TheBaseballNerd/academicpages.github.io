## Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV) causes severe neurologic complications and fetal aberrations. Vaccine development is hindered by potential safety concerns due to antibody cross-reactivity with dengue virus and the possibility of disease enhancement. In contrast, passive administration of anti-ZIKV antibodies engineered to prevent enhancement may be safe and effective. Here, we report on human monoclonal antibody Z021, a potent neutralizer that recognizes an epitope on the lateral ridge of the envelope domain III (EDIII) of ZIKV and is protective against ZIKV in mice. When administered to macaques undergoing a high-dose ZIKV challenge, a single anti-EDIII antibody selected for resistant variants. Co-administration of two antibodies, Z004 and Z021, which target distinct sites on EDIII, was associated with a delay and a 3- to 4-log decrease in peak viremia. Moreover, the combination of these antibodies engineered to avoid enhancement prevented viral escape due to mutation in macaques, a natural host for ZIKV.
