## Abstract
Scented sugar baits deployed in California deserts detected early West Nile virus (WNV) transmission by mosquitoes,
representing a potential improvement to conventional arbovirus surveillance that relies heavily on infection rates
in mosquito pools. In this study, we expanded deployment of scented sugar baits into suburban Sacramento and
Yolo (2015, 2016) and Riverside Counties (2016), California. The goal of the study was to determine whether scented
sugar baits detect WNV and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) concurrent with mosquito infections in trapped
pools in areas of high human density. Between 8 and 10% of sugar baits were WNV RNA positive in both study
years across the three counties. In Riverside County, where SLEV re-emerged in 2015, 1% of sugar baits were
SLEV positive in 2016. Rates of sugar bait positives were at least 100 times higher than infection rates in trapped
mosquitoes in the same districts. The prevalence of sugar bait positives varied temporally and did not coincide with
infections in mosquitoes collected at the same sites each week. WNV RNA positive sugar baits were detected up to
2 wk before and after concurrent surveillance detected infection in mosquito pools at the same sites. Sugar baits
also detected WNV in Riverside County at locations where no WNV activity was detected in mosquito pools. Sugar
baits generated between 0.8 and 1.2 WNV positives per 1,000 dollars and can be more economical than carbon dioxide
baited traps that produce 0.8 positives per 1,000 dollars. These results indicate that the sugar bait approach enhances
conventional arbovirus surveillance in mosquitoes in suburban California.
