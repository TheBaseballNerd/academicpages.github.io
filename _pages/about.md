# About Me

* I graduated from University of California, Davis with a B.S. in [Global Disease Biology](https://gdb.ucdavis.edu/) and a Minor in African History in Spring 2017. I joined the [Pathobiology](https://globalhealth.washington.edu/education-training/phd-pathobiology) program at University of Washington, Seattle in Fall 2019.
* I worked for approximately three years (Summer 2016 - Summer 2019) in [Lark Coffey's lab](https://coffeylab.ucdavis.edu/) at UC Davis as an Undergraduate and Research Technician. In June 2020, I joined [Leslie Goo's lab](https://research.fhcrc.org/goo/en.html) as a PhD Student.
* My non-academic interests include: Backpacking and hiking, Byzantine history, politics, my dog, vegetarian cooking, and reading.
